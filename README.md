# Random Password Generator

## Description

This week's challenge tested my Javascript knowledge. A starter code was provided. If the proper code was added to the starting code, the "Generate a Password" button should present the user with a prompt that asks for them to input a number. Ater following each additional prompt you will be given a random password with a combination of letters, numbers and special characters.
